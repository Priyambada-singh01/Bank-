PROBLEM TASK - PRIMARY
Problem Description
You are tasked with implementing two functions to apply a `10%` discount to a list of prices using two different approaches:

List-based approach:
Given a list of prices, apply a `10%` discount to each price by iterating through the list and appending the discounted prices to a new list.

NumPy-based approach:
Using a NumPy array, apply the `10%` discount to all prices at once by performing vectorized operations.

You need to implement two functions that return the respective discounted prices.

Function Signatures:
```
discount_prices_list(prices_list)
discount_prices_numpy(prices_array)
```
<br>
Sample Input 1:
```
[100, 200, 300, 400]
```
Sample Output 1:
```
Discounted Prices (List): [90.0, 180.0, 270.0, 360.0]
Discounted Prices (NumPy Array): [ 90.0, 180.0, 270.0, 360.0]
```
<br>
Sample Input 2:
```
[50, 150, 250, 350]
```
Sample Output 2:
```
Discounted Prices (List): [45.0, 135.0, 225.0, 315.0]
Discounted Prices (NumPy Array): [ 45.0, 135.0, 225.0, 315.0]
```
<br>
Notes
The List-based approach should use a loop to iterate over each element and apply the discount.
The NumPy-based approach should apply the discount using vectorized operations for better performance.
